The final prototype can be found in Server V4. To run it, follow the steps below:

1. Copy the file path of app.py, and run it in your Windows Terminal. Import the necessary packages where needed.
2. Copy and paste the website hyperlink generated into a new browser tab.
3. Key in the relevant input parameters - a selection of valid ports are:

NZAKL / AKL, SGSIN / SIN, INNSA / BOM, CNQZH / NNG, AUMEL / MEL, LHR.

4. View the available routes, and make use of the modifiers! The Google Map may not be generated, as an API key is required.
